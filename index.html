        <p class="content left"> 
                <p class="post">We met in band at Wartburg, during the first week of classes. Prior to classes starting, all prospective band members were required to audition for band and seating placements. We were seated next to each other, and ended up being stand partners. It took Marc about a month to even remember Luann's name. However, we slowly became friends over the course of the year. That friendship grew as Luann introduced Marc to Stargate, and Marc introduced Luann to Doctor Who. Over the years while attending Wartburg, we spent quite a bit of time together, and with our mutual friends.</p>

                <p class="welcomePageBlogTitle">We Are Dating...FINALLY!</p>
                <P class="post">As time progressed, Marc left Wartburg to pursue a degree in Computer Science down in Missouri. It was only after we were separated for over a year that we decided to start dating. Marc went to visit Luann in Rochester, MN the weekend of Wartburg homecoming. It was that weekend that Marc FINALLY asked Luann out. Unfortunately, it turned into a long distance relationship as Marc soon had to return to Missouri. For the next 1 1/2 years, we continued to maintain our long distance relationship. Even after Marc finished at SEMO, he went to live in Detroit while he worked on a contract for Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>

                <p class="post">It wasn't until the completion of that contract that Marc was finally able to get a job in Minnesota. At this point is when we began looking for a place to live. Our search finally led us to Dundas, MN where we now live.</p>
